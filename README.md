My attempt at increasing my brains numerical capability using Mercury

I had heard of this for a long time ago but a recent conversation on LinkedIn
lately has made me want to return and this time,

 - use Mercury

 yet. It's on a level with LISP for being a paradigm shifter. I highly advise
 giving it a look.

These sample solutions were built with Mercury 22.01, released 31 March 2022.
